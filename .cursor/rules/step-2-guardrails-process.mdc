# Guardrails and Process

This document defines the standards, rules, and expected process for all project contributorsâ€”AI or human. It ensures consistency, quality, and transparency.

## Guardrails
- *Type Safety:* All source must be in TypeScript, models strictly typed.
- *Atomic PRs:* Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review.
- *Test Coverage:* All features require associated unit and E2E tests.
- *Code Review:* Every PR is reviewed and must pass CI (lint, accessibility, test, typing) before merge.
- *Documentation:* All major work is self-documented (inline, PR summary, markdown as needed).

## Process Steps
1. *Task Is Defined:* The feature/fix/request is added to the task board with context and acceptance criteria.
2. *PRD/ARCHITECT/TEST Docs:* Draft (or update) corresponding documentation, including technical diagrams.
3. *Development:* Branch, code, and update docs as you go. Run tests and validate.
4. *Pull Request:* Open a PR, attach docs, pass CI checks.
5. *Review/Approval:* AI/human reviewers ensure compliance and clarity. Flag regressions/process violations.
6. *Merge/Release:* Only after all checks and approvals. Automated deployment for qualified builds.

## Roles
- *Cursor AI/MCP:* Can automate process, but must follow the same guardrails.
- *Developers/Admins:* May intervene for ambiguous, risky, or regulatory features.

> All contributors must follow these guardrails for every change and feature.
