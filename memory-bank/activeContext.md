2. **User Experience Refinement**: Ensure all implemented features work seamlessly with intuitive interactions
3. **Memory Bank Documentation**: Establish comprehensive project documentation for consistent development
4. **Feature Preservation**: Maintain all existing functionality while making improvements

### Recent Sprint Goals (Completed)
- ✅ Fixed folder visibility issues and component imports
- ✅ Implemented folder-first approach as default view mode
- ✅ Capitalized all H1, H2, H3 headings throughout application
- ✅ Enhanced mass delete functionality with discoverable Select button
- ✅ Removed Simple Add feature per user request
- ✅ Established environment-first development approach

## Recent Changes & Implementations

### Major Feature Updates (Last Session)

#### 1. **Folder-First Dashboard Implementation**
- **Change**: Modified default view mode from 'grid' to 'folders'
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/dashboard/bookmark-hub-dashboard.tsx`
- **Impact**: Users now see folders as the primary organization method
- **Rationale**: Aligns with user's vision of folder-centric bookmark management

#### 2. **Comprehensive Heading Capitalization**
- **Scope**: All H1, H2, H3 headings across entire application
- **Files Modified**: 15+ component files including:
  - Dashboard components
  - Navigation and sidebar
  - Analytics pages
  - Settings components
  - Document editor components
- **Pattern**: Consistent `ALL CAPS` formatting for headings
- **User Preference**: Maintains professional appearance with strong visual hierarchy

#### 3. **Folder Name Capitalization System**
- **Implementation**: Dynamic `.toUpperCase()` applied to folder names in display
- **Scope**: All components where folder names are shown
- **Default Folders**: Updated to `DEVELOPMENT`, `DESIGN`, `PRODUCTIVITY`, `LEARNING`, `ENTERTAINMENT`
- **Preservation**: Sidebar categories remain in normal case (Development, Design, etc.)

#### 4. **Enhanced Mass Delete Functionality**
- **Problem**: Mass delete functionality was hidden and not discoverable
- **Solution**: Added prominent "Select" button to dashboard
- **Implementation**: 
  - Refactored dashboard component structure
  - Added `BookmarkHubDashboardContent` with selection context
  - Integrated CheckSquare icon and selection state management
- **User Experience**: Clear toggle between normal and selection modes

#### 5. **Simple Add Feature Removal**
- **Scope**: Complete removal of Simple Add bookmark functionality
- **Cleaned Up**: Unused imports, state variables, and handlers
- **Preserved**: Advanced bookmark form with full metadata capture
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/dashboard/bookmark-hub-dashboard.tsx`

### Component Architecture Improvements

#### Dashboard Component Restructure
```typescript
// Previous structure
BookmarkHubDashboard (monolithic component)

// New structure
BookmarkHubDashboard (wrapper)
  └── BookmarkHubDashboardContent (with selection context)
      ├── Header with Select button
      ├── MassActionsToolbar (conditional)
      └── Content views (folders, grid, list, etc.)
```

#### Selection Context Integration
- Enhanced `SelectionContext` usage in dashboard
- Clear visual feedback for selection mode
- Proper state management for bulk operations

3. **Search Functionality**: Real-time search with debouncing
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select mode activation and mass actions
5. **Theme Switching**: Persistent theme preferences
6. **Mobile Navigation**: Responsive sidebar and mobile menu

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Environment Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any regression issues
2. **User Experience Validation**: Verify all features work as expected from user perspective
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor load times and interaction responsiveness
4. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep memory bank updated with any new changes

### Feature Considerations (Medium Priority)
1. **AI-Powered Features**: 
   - Smart categorization suggestions
   - Duplicate bookmark detection
   - Content analysis and auto-tagging
2. **Advanced Search**:
   - Natural language search queries
   - Visual similarity search
   - Saved search filters
3. **Import/Export**:
   - Browser bookmark import
   - CSV/JSON export functionality
   - Bulk organization tools

### Technical Improvements (Low Priority)
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Virtual scrolling for large bookmark collections
   - Image lazy loading optimization
   - Search result caching
2. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Keyboard navigation improvements
   - Screen reader optimization
   - Focus management refinement
3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Component unit tests
   - E2E testing scenarios
   - Performance testing

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions
- **Folder-First Approach**: Confirmed as primary organizational paradigm
- **Heading Capitalization**: ALL CAPS format for strong visual hierarchy
- **Professional Interface**: Clean, minimal design without emojis on buttons
- **Selection Mode**: Toggle-based approach for bulk operations

### Technical Decisions
- **Component Structure**: Favor composition over monolithic components
- **State Management**: React Context for global state, local state for component-specific data
- **Error Handling**: Environment-first approach - fix issues before adding features
- **User Control**: Only make changes explicitly requested by user

### User Preferences Established
- **Environment-First Development**: Always ensure stability before new features
- **Explicit Change Requests**: No independent modifications without user instruction
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, business-appropriate interface design
- **Functional Priority**: Preserve existing functionality during improvements

## Context for Future Development

### User Communication Style
- User prefers direct, explicit instructions
- Values stability and consistency over rapid feature addition
- Appreciates thorough error checking and environment validation
- Expects changes only when specifically requested

### Development Approach
- **Environment First**: Always verify and fix issues before implementing new features
- **Preservation Focus**: Maintain existing functionality during modifications
- **User-Driven**: Only implement features and changes explicitly requested
- **Documentation Heavy**: Maintain comprehensive memory bank for project continuity

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Component composition over large monolithic components
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Consistent naming conventions and code organization

## Current Focus
- Time Capsule feature fully restored (UI, API endpoints, backend service, Clerk integration)
- All code recovered from backup and tested
- No new errors introduced

## Recent Changes
- Restored all Time Capsule UI components and dialogs
- Restored API endpoints and backend service logic
- Updated settings page to include Time Capsule tab
- Fixed GitHub push protection issue (removed secret from commit)

## Next Steps
- Monitor for edge-case errors
- Continue documentation updates as needed

This active context provides the current state foundation for continuing development work on the BookmarkHub project.
