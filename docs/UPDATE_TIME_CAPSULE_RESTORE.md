# Update: Time Capsule Feature Restored (June 2025)

## Summary
- The Time Capsule feature has been fully restored in Appitivity v1.
- This includes the UI (settings tab, dialogs), API endpoints, backend service logic, and Clerk authentication integration.
- All code was recovered from backup and tested for correct operation.

## Details
### UI
- **Settings Tab:** A new "Time Capsule" tab is available in the settings area.
- **Dialogs:** Create, view, and restore dialogs are fully functional.

### API
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/api/time-capsules` (list, create)
  - `/api/time-capsules/[id]` (view, update, delete)
  - `/api/time-capsules/[id]/restore` (restore data)
  - `/api/time-capsules/stats` (statistics)
- All endpoints use Clerk authentication and profile normalization.

### Backend
- **Service:** `TimeCapsuleService` restored in `src/lib/services/time-capsule.ts`.
- **Middleware:** `ensureProfileMiddleware` restored for user profile checks.

### Testing
- Lint, type-check, and tests run before and after restoration.
- No new errors introduced; all Time Capsule operations verified.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge-case errors.
- Update documentation as new features are added.
