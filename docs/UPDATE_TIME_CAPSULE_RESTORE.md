# Update: Time Capsule Feature Restored (June 2025)

## MCP Workflow Status
- All changes were committed, synced, and pushed to GitHub using the local GitHub MCP Docker toolset (`activate-mcp.sh github`).
- Documentation is now being updated using the Docs MCP as part of the automated workflow.
- This ensures full compliance with the MCP-based automation and audit requirements for Appitivityv1.git.

## Summary
- The Time Capsule feature has been fully restored in Appitivity v1.
- This includes the UI (settings tab, dialogs), API endpoints, backend service logic, and Clerk authentication integration.
- All code was recovered from backup and tested for correct operation.

## Details
### UI
- **Settings Tab:** A new "Time Capsule" tab is available in the settings area.
- **Dialogs:** Create, view, and restore dialogs are fully functional.

### API
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/api/time-capsules` (list, create)
  - `/api/time-capsules/[id]` (view, update, delete)
  - `/api/time-capsules/[id]/restore` (restore data)
  - `/api/time-capsules/stats` (statistics)
- All endpoints use Clerk authentication and profile normalization.

### Backend
- **Service:** `TimeCapsuleService` restored in `src/lib/services/time-capsule.ts`.
- **Middleware:** `ensureProfileMiddleware` restored in `src/lib/middleware/ensure-profile.ts`.

### Testing & Verification
- All features tested locally and verified to work with Clerk authentication and Supabase integration.
- No new errors introduced; project is stable after restoration.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for edge-case errors.
- Continue documentation and knowledge graph updates as needed.
