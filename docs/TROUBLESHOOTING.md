## Issue: Deeply Corrupted Next.js Development Environment (June 2024)

### Symptoms

The application was unstable and failed to load consistently. The development server produced a wide range of misleading errors, including but not limited to:

-   Persistent webpack caching failures (`[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack...`).
-   `ENOENT` (file not found) errors for critical vendor chunks, such as `@supabase.js`, `@clerk.js`, and `next.js`.
-   False-positive "Duplicate export" errors for components with valid syntax.
-   Miscellaneous syntax errors ("Expression expected") that were not present in the source code.

These issues persisted despite standard cleanup measures like deleting the `.next` folder.

### Root Cause

The root cause was determined to be a deeply corrupted development environment, where multiple layers of caching (Next.js build cache, npm cache) were returning stale or invalid data.

### Resolution Steps

A systematic and aggressive cleanup of the entire development environment was required to resolve the issue. The following multi-stage process was successful:

1.  **Halt All Processes:** Ensure no development servers or related processes are running. A `pkill -f "next"` command was used to terminate any stray processes.

2.  **Aggressive Environment Purge:** All potentially corrupt local artifacts were deleted from the project root:
    -   The `.next` build cache directory.
    -   The `node_modules` directory.
    -   The `package-lock.json` file.

3.  **Global Cache Clearing:** The global npm cache was forcefully cleared to prevent the re-introduction of corrupted packages:
    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

4.  **Clean Dependency Installation:** All project dependencies were reinstalled from scratch:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Production Build Verification:** A production build was executed to confirm the integrity of the source code against the clean environment. This step was crucial as it compiled the application without using the problematic development server cache.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The build completed successfully, confirming the source code was not the issue.

6.  **Restart Development Server:** Finally, the development server was started, and it ran stably without any of the previous errors.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This process restored the development environment to a pristine state and fully resolved the loading and compilation issues.
