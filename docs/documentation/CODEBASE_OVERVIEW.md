## üö® **Potential Cleanup Candidates**

> *Folders with minimal files that might be leftovers or need consolidation:*

- **[`src/contexts/`](./src/contexts/)** - Only contains `SelectionContext.tsx` (1 file) - Consider moving to components or consolidating
- **[`src/hooks/`](./src/hooks/)** - Contains 4 custom hooks - Small but actively used
- **[`__pycache__/`](./__pycache__)** - Python cache directory - Should be in `.gitignore`
- **[`.swc/`](./.swc/)** - SWC compiler cache - Should be in `.gitignore`
- **[`~`](./~)** - Temporary directory - Likely leftover, should be removed
