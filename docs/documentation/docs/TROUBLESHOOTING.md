## Issue: Deeply Corrupted Next.js Development Environment (June 2024)

### Symptoms

The application was unstable and failed to load consistently. The development server produced a wide range of misleading errors, including but not limited to:

-   Persistent webpack caching failures (`[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack...`).
-   `ENOENT` (file not found) errors for critical vendor chunks, such as `@supabase.js`, `@clerk.js`, and `next.js`.
-   False-positive "Duplicate export" errors for components with valid syntax.
-   Miscellaneous syntax errors ("Expression expected") that were not present in the source code.

These issues persisted despite multiple attempts to clean the environment by deleting the `.next` directory.

### Resolution

A permanent fix was achieved by performing a more aggressive, multi-step environment purification process. This indicates the root cause was not an error in the application code, but a deeply corrupted state within the Next.js build and cache system.

The following steps were taken:

1.  **Halt All Activity:** All running `next dev` processes were terminated to prevent further file system interference.
2.  **Full Artifact Purge:** All local build artifacts and dependencies were deleted by running:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
    ```
3.  **Global Cache Clear:** The global npm cache was forcibly cleared to ensure no tainted packages would be reused:
    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    ```
4.  **Pristine Reinstall:** All project dependencies were reinstalled from scratch:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Production Build Validation:** A production build was executed to confirm the integrity of the source code in a clean environment. This step was critical as it successfully compiled the project, proving the errors were environmental.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

After these steps, the development server (`npm run dev`) was able to start and run stably without any of the previous errors. This process should be the first course of action if similar difficult-to-diagnose build failures occur in the future.
