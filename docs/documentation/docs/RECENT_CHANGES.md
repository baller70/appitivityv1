## View Selector Fix (Commit: 78ccb7e0)
**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed and Deployed

### Problem
The view selector in the bookmark dashboard was disappearing when users selected the "Folder Grid" view mode. This was caused by conditional JSX rendering logic that placed the view selector inside an `else` block that only displayed when `viewMode !== 'folder-grid'`.

### Solution
Restructured the JSX conditional logic in `src/components/dashboard/bookmark-hub-dashboard.tsx`:

1. **Moved view selector outside conditional blocks** - Now always visible regardless of selected view mode
2. **Removed duplicate folder-grid conditions** - Eliminated redundant conditional checks causing JSX structure issues
3. **Connected proper event handlers** - Integrated folder operations with correct handler functions instead of empty placeholders
4. **Fixed JSX structure** - Resolved syntax errors and malformed conditional expressions

### Technical Details
```typescript
// BEFORE: View selector hidden in folder-grid mode
{viewMode === 'folder-grid' ? (
  <FolderGridView ... />
) : (
  <>
    {/* View selector only shown when NOT folder-grid */}
    {/* Other views */}
  </>
)}

// AFTER: View selector always visible
{/* View selector always shown */}
{viewMode === 'folder-grid' ? (
  <FolderGridView ... />
) : viewMode === 'list' ? (
  <ListView ... />
) : /* other views */}
```

### Files Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/bookmark-hub-dashboard.tsx` - Main fix implementation
- `.cursor/mcp.json` - Added Supabase MCP configuration
- `package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies

### Testing
- ✅ Application compiles successfully
- ✅ All view modes functional (Grid, List, Kanban, Timeline, Folder Grid, Compact, Detailed, Goals)
- ✅ View selector remains visible across all modes
- ✅ No JSX syntax errors
- ✅ Server running on localhost:3000

## 2025-06-16

### Bookmark Detail Modal
- Merged **Notifications** and **Reminders** into a single "Notifications" tab. All reminder functionality now appears within this tab under its own heading.
- Removed **Progress** tab. Key learning-progress metrics will be revisited in a future analytics redesign.
- Consolidated **Documents & Notes** into the **Media** tab. Users can now manage images and documents from one place.
- Moved **Related Bookmarks** section to the bottom of the **Overview** tab for quicker access.

### Sidebar Cleanup
- Deleted obsolete *Categories*, *Statistics*, and *Insights* blocks from both classic and enhanced sidebars.

### Component Library
- Added missing shadcn/ui primitives (Accordion, Avatar, AspectRatio, Command, Context-Menu, Hover-Card, Alert-Dialog, Radio-Group, Skeleton, Toggle) with corresponding Radix dependencies.

### Miscellaneous
- Updated TypeScript types and lint rules; all tests, type-checks, and lints pass.
- Committed and pushed to `main` (`b3b428c2`).
