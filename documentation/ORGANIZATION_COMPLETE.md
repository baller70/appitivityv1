## Cleanup Completed
- 🗑️ Removed build artifacts (`.next/`, `.swc/`, `__pycache__/`)
- 🗑️ Cleaned up temporary directories
- 🗑️ Organized all configuration files
- 🗑️ Moved all scripts to appropriate locations

## VS Code Workspace Created
- ✅ `project.code-workspace` with optimized settings
- ✅ Emoji-labeled folders for easy navigation
- ✅ Performance optimizations included

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Clean Root Directory**: Only essential directories and workspace file remain
2. **Logical Organization**: Files grouped by purpose and function
3. **Improved Navigation**: Easy to find related files
4. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Scalable Structure**: Ready for future growth

## Next Steps
1. Use the VS Code workspace file for optimal development experience
2. All development can now proceed with the clean, organized structure
3. New files should be added to the appropriate category directories

**🎉 Repository organization is now COMPLETE and ready for productive development!**
