## How Analytics Routing Works

### From Bookmark Detail Modal
1. Open any bookmark detail modal
2. Navigate to "Overview" tab
3. Click "View Full Analytics" button
4. Opens: `/analytics?bookmark={bookmark-id}`
5. Analytics page focuses on that specific bookmark

### From Dashboard Navigation
1. Click "Analytics" in sidebar navigation
2. Opens: `/analytics` (main analytics page)
3. Shows comprehensive analytics for all user bookmarks

### From Bookmark Cards
1. Click external link button on bookmark cards
2. Tracks visit via `/api/bookmarks/visit` endpoint
3. Updates visit count in real-time
4. Analytics page reflects changes immediately

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Zero State
```bash
# Visit the dashboard
http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Check analytics page
http://localhost:3000/analytics
```
**Expected**: All numbers should show 0 visits

### 2. Test Visit Tracking
1. Click any bookmark's external link button
2. Visit count should increment from 0 to 1
3. Analytics should update in real-time

### 3. Test Bookmark-Specific Analytics
1. Open any bookmark detail modal
2. Click "View Full Analytics" button
3. Should open analytics page focused on that bookmark
4. URL should include `?bookmark={id}` parameter

### 4. Test User Isolation
1. All analytics should be user-specific
2. No data from other users should appear
3. Visit counts should only reflect current user's activity

## Key Features Confirmed Working

### ✅ User-Specific Analytics
- Each user sees only their own bookmark data
- Visit counts are isolated per user
- Analytics calculations are user-scoped

### ✅ Real-Time Updates
- Visit tracking updates immediately
- Analytics page refreshes every 30 seconds
- Live data synchronization across components

### ✅ Proper Routing
- Main analytics page: `/analytics`
- Bookmark-specific: `/analytics?bookmark={id}`
